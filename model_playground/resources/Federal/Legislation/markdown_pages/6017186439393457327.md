#### (2) Special rules for permanent resident aliens
#### (A) Release hearing
An alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence shall be entitled to a release hearing before the judge assigned to hear the removal hearing. Such an alien shall be detained pending the removal hearing, unless the alien demonstrates to the court that the alien-
(i) is a person lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States;
(ii) if released upon such terms and conditions as the court may prescribe (including the posting of any monetary amount), is not likely to flee; and
(iii) will not endanger national security, or the safety of any person or the community, if released.
#### (B) Information considered
The judge may consider classified information submitted in camera and ex parte in making a determination whether to release an alien pending the removal hearing.
#### (3) Release if order denied and no review sought
#### (A) In general
Subject to subparagraph (B), if a judge of the removal court denies the order sought in an application filed pursuant to section 1533 of this title, and the Attorney General does not seek review of such denial, the alien shall be released from custody.
#### (B) Application of regular procedures
Subparagraph (A) shall not prevent the arrest and detention of the alien pursuant to subchapter II.
#### (b) Conditional release if order denied and review sought
#### (1) In general
If a judge of the removal court denies the order sought in an application filed pursuant to section 1533 of this title and the Attorney General seeks review of such denial, the judge shall release the alien from custody subject to the least restrictive condition, or combination of conditions, of release described in section 3142(b) and clauses (i) through (xiv) of section 3142(c)(1)(B) of title 18 that-
(A) will reasonably assure the appearance of the alien at any future proceeding pursuant to this subchapter; and
(B) will not endanger the safety of any other person or the community.
