(2) for any person to transport or attempt to transport from or into the United States another person with knowledge or reasonable cause to believe that the departure or entry of such other person is forbidden by this section;

#### (b) Citizens
Except as otherwise provided by the President and subject to such limitations and exceptions as the President may authorize and prescribe, it shall be unlawful for any citizen of the United States to depart from or enter, or attempt to depart from or enter, the United States unless he bears a valid United States passport.
#### (c) Definitions

The term "person" as used in this section shall be deemed to mean any individual, partnership, association, company, or other incorporated body of individuals, or corporation, or body politic.
#### (d) Nonadmission of certain aliens

#### (e) Revocation of proclamation as affecting penalties
The revocation of any rule, regulation, or order issued in pursuance of this section shall not prevent prosecution for any offense committed, or the imposition of any penalties or forfeitures, liability for which was incurred under this section prior to the revocation of such rule, regulation, or order.

"(vii) a single implementation date for sea and land borders has been established; and

"(C) Report.-Not later than 180 days after the initiation of the pilot program described in subparagraph (B)(viii), the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report which includes-

"(iii) any appropriate statutory changes to facilitate the expansion of the pilot program to additional States and to citizens of Canada;
"(iv) a plan to screen individuals participating in the pilot program against United States terrorist watch lists; and
"(v) a recommendation for the type of machine-readable technology that should be used in enhanced driver's licenses, based on individual privacy considerations and the costs and feasibility of incorporating any new technology into existing driver's licenses.
"(2) Requirement to produce documentation.-The plan developed under paragraph (1) shall require all United States citizens, and categories of individuals for whom documentation requirements have previously been waived under section 212(d)(4)(B) of such Act [8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(4)(B)], to carry and produce the documentation described in paragraph (1) when traveling from foreign countries into the United States.
"(c) Technical and Conforming Amendments.-After the complete implementation of the plan described in subsection (b)-
"(1) neither the Secretary of State nor the Secretary of Homeland Security may exercise discretion under section 212(d)(4)(B) of such Act [8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(4)(B)] to waive documentary requirements for travel into the United States; and
"(2) the President may not exercise discretion under section 215(b) of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1185(b)) to waive documentary requirements for United States citizens departing from or entering, or attempting to depart from or enter, the United States except-
"(A) where the Secretary of Homeland Security determines that the alternative documentation that is the basis for the waiver of the documentary requirement is sufficient to denote identity and citizenship;
"(B) in the case of an unforeseen emergency in individual cases; or
"(C) in the case of humanitarian or national interest reasons in individual cases.
"(d) Transit Without Visa Program.-The Secretary of State shall not use any authorities granted under section 212(d)(4)(C) of such Act [8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(4)(C)] until the Secretary, in conjunction with the Secretary of Homeland Security, completely implements a security plan to fully ensure secure transit passage areas to prevent aliens proceeding in immediate and continuous transit through the United States from illegally entering the United States."
[Amendment by Pub. L. 110–161, §545, to section 7209 of Pub. L. 108–458, set out above, was executed to reflect the probable intent of Congress, notwithstanding errors in the directory language.]
