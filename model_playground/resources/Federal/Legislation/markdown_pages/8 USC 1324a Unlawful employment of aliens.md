 (A) to hire, or to recruit or refer for a fee, for employment in the United States an alien knowing the alien is an unauthorized alien (as defined in subsection (h)(3\)) with respect to such employment, or
 (B)(i) to hire for employment in the United States an individual without complying with the requirements of subsection (b) or (ii) if the person or entity is an agricultural association, agricultural employer, or farm labor contractor (as defined in
 section 1802 of title 29
 ), to hire, or to recruit or refer for a fee, for employment in the United States an individual without complying with the requirements of subsection (b).
#### (2\) Continuing employment
 It is unlawful for a person or other entity, after hiring an alien for employment in accordance with paragraph (1\), to continue to employ the alien in the United States knowing the alien is (or has become) an unauthorized alien with respect to such employment.
#### (3\) Defense
 A person or entity that establishes that it has complied in good faith with the requirements of subsection (b) with respect to the hiring, recruiting, or referral for employment of an alien in the United States has established an affirmative defense that the person or entity has not violated paragraph (1\)(A) with respect to such hiring, recruiting, or referral.
#### (4\) Use of labor through contract
 For purposes of this section, a person or other entity who uses a contract, subcontract, or exchange, entered into, renegotiated, or extended after November 6, 1986, to obtain the labor of an alien in the United States knowing that the alien is an unauthorized alien (as defined in subsection (h)(3\)) with respect to performing such labor, shall be considered to have hired the alien for employment in the United States in violation of paragraph (1\)(A).
#### (5\) Use of State employment agency documentation
 For purposes of paragraphs (1\)(B) and (3\), a person or entity shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements of subsection (b) with respect to the hiring of an individual who was referred for such employment by a State employment agency (as defined by the Attorney General), if the person or entity has and retains (for the period and in the manner described in subsection (b)(3\)) appropriate documentation of such referral by that agency, which documentation certifies that the agency has complied with the procedures specified in subsection (b) with respect to the individual's referral.
#### (6\) Treatment of documentation for certain employees
#### (A) In general
 For purposes of this section, if\-
 (i) an individual is a member of a collective\-bargaining unit and is employed, under a collective bargaining agreement entered into between one or more employee organizations and an association of two or more employers, by an employer that is a member of such association, and
 (ii) within the period specified in subparagraph (B), another employer that is a member of the association (or an agent of such association on behalf of the employer) has complied with the requirements of subsection (b) with respect to the employment of the individual,
 the subsequent employer shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements of subsection (b) with respect to the hiring of the employee and shall not be liable for civil penalties described in subsection (e)(5\).
#### (B) Period
 The period described in this subparagraph is 3 years, or, if less, the period of time that the individual is authorized to be employed in the United States.
#### (C) Liability
#### (i) In general
 If any employer that is a member of an association hires for employment in the United States an individual and relies upon the provisions of subparagraph (A) to comply with the requirements of subsection (b) and the individual is an alien not authorized to work in the United States, then for the purposes of paragraph (1\)(A), subject to clause (ii), the employer shall be presumed to have known at the time of hiring or afterward that the individual was an alien not authorized to work in the United States.
#### (ii) Rebuttal of presumption
 The presumption established by clause (i) may be rebutted by the employer only through the presentation of clear and convincing evidence that the employer did not know (and could not reasonably have known) that the individual at the time of hiring or afterward was an alien not authorized to work in the United States.
#### (iii) Exception
 Clause (i) shall not apply in any prosecution under subsection (f)(1\).
#### (7\) Application to Federal Government
 For purposes of this section, the term "entity" includes an entity in any branch of the Federal Government.
#### (b) Employment verification system
 The requirements referred to in paragraphs (1\)(B) and (3\) of subsection (a) are, in the case of a person or other entity hiring, recruiting, or referring an individual for employment in the United States, the requirements specified in the following three paragraphs:
#### (1\) Attestation after examination of documentation
#### (A) In general
 The person or entity must attest, under penalty of perjury and on a form designated or established by the Attorney General by regulation, that it has verified that the individual is not an unauthorized alien by examining\-
 (i) a document described in subparagraph (B), or
 (ii) a document described in subparagraph (C) and a document described in subparagraph (D).
 Such attestation may be manifested by either a hand\-written or an electronic signature. A person or entity has complied with the requirement of this paragraph with respect to examination of a document if the document reasonably appears on its face to be genuine. If an individual provides a document or combination of documents that reasonably appears on its face to be genuine and that is sufficient to meet the requirements of the first sentence of this paragraph, nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as requiring the person or entity to solicit the production of any other document or as requiring the individual to produce such another document.
#### (B) Documents establishing both employment authorization and identity
 A document described in this subparagraph is an individual's\-
 (i) United States passport;
 1
 (ii) resident alien card, alien registration card, or other document designated by the Attorney General, if the document\-
 (I) contains a photograph of the individual and such other personal identifying information relating to the individual as the Attorney General finds, by regulation, sufficient for purposes of this subsection,
 (II) is evidence of authorization of employment in the United States, and
 (III) contains security features to make it resistant to tampering, counterfeiting, and fraudulent use.
#### (C) Documents evidencing employment authorization
 A document described in this subparagraph is an individual's\-
 (i) social security account number card (other than such a card which specifies on the face that the issuance of the card does not authorize employment in the United States); or
 (ii) other documentation evidencing authorization of employment in the United States which the Attorney General finds, by regulation, to be acceptable for purposes of this section.
#### (D) Documents establishing identity of individual
 A document described in this subparagraph is an individual's\-
 (i) driver's license or similar document issued for the purpose of identification by a State, if it contains a photograph of the individual or such other personal identifying information relating to the individual as the Attorney General finds, by regulation, sufficient for purposes of this section; or
 (ii) in the case of individuals under 16 years of age or in a State which does not provide for issuance of an identification document (other than a driver's license) referred to in clause (i), documentation of personal identity of such other type as the Attorney General finds, by regulation, provides a reliable means of identification.
#### (E) Authority to prohibit use of certain documents
 If the Attorney General finds, by regulation, that any document described in subparagraph (B), (C), or (D) as establishing employment authorization or identity does not reliably establish such authorization or identity or is being used fraudulently to an unacceptable degree, the Attorney General may prohibit or place conditions on its use for purposes of this subsection.
#### (2\) Individual attestation of employment authorization
 The individual must attest, under penalty of perjury on the form designated or established for purposes of paragraph (1\), that the individual is a citizen or national of the United States, an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or an alien who is authorized under this chapter or by the Attorney General to be hired, recruited, or referred for such employment. Such attestation may be manifested by either a hand\-written or an electronic signature.
#### (3\) Retention of verification form
 After completion of such form in accordance with paragraphs (1\) and (2\), the person or entity must retain a paper, microfiche, microfilm, or electronic version of the form and make it available for inspection by officers of the Service, the Special Counsel for Immigration\-Related Unfair Employment Practices, or the Department of Labor during a period beginning on the date of the hiring, recruiting, or referral of the individual and ending\-
 (A) in the case of the recruiting or referral for a fee (without hiring) of an individual, three years after the date of the recruiting or referral, and
 (B) in the case of the hiring of an individual\-
 (i) three years after the date of such hiring, or
 (ii) one year after the date the individual's employment is terminated,
 whichever is later.
#### (4\) Copying of documentation permitted
 Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the person or entity may copy a document presented by an individual pursuant to this subsection and may retain the copy, but only (except as otherwise permitted under law) for the purpose of complying with the requirements of this subsection.
#### (5\) Limitation on use of attestation form
 A form designated or established by the Attorney General under this subsection and any information contained in or appended to such form, may not be used for purposes other than for enforcement of this chapter and
 sections 1001, 1028, 1546, and 1621 of title 18
 .
#### (6\) Good faith compliance
#### (A) In general
 Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), a person or entity is considered to have complied with a requirement of this subsection notwithstanding a technical or procedural failure to meet such requirement if there was a good faith attempt to comply with the requirement.
#### (B) Exception if failure to correct after notice
 Subparagraph (A) shall not apply if\-
 (i) the Service (or another enforcement agency) has explained to the person or entity the basis for the failure,
 (ii) the person or entity has been provided a period of not less than 10 business days (beginning after the date of the explanation) within which to correct the failure, and
 (iii) the person or entity has not corrected the failure voluntarily within such period.
#### (C) Exception for pattern or practice violators
 Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to a person or entity that has or is engaging in a pattern or practice of violations of subsection (a)(1\)(A) or (a)(2\).

 Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize, directly or indirectly, the issuance or use of national identification cards or the establishment of a national identification card.
#### (d) Evaluation and changes in employment verification system
#### (1\) Presidential monitoring and improvements in system
#### (A) Monitoring
 The President shall provide for the monitoring and evaluation of the degree to which the employment verification system established under subsection (b) provides a secure system to determine employment eligibility in the United States and shall examine the suitability of existing Federal and State identification systems for use for this purpose.
#### (B) Improvements to establish secure system
 To the extent that the system established under subsection (b) is found not to be a secure system to determine employment eligibility in the United States, the President shall, subject to paragraph (3\) and taking into account the results of any demonstration projects conducted under paragraph (4\), implement such changes in (including additions to) the requirements of subsection (b) as may be necessary to establish a secure system to determine employment eligibility in the United States. Such changes in the system may be implemented only if the changes conform to the requirements of paragraph (2\).
#### (2\) Restrictions on changes in system
 Any change the President proposes to implement under paragraph (1\) in the verification system must be designed in a manner so the verification system, as so changed, meets the following requirements:
#### (A) Reliable determination of identity
 The system must be capable of reliably determining whether\-
 (i) a person with the identity claimed by an employee or prospective employee is eligible to work, and
 (ii) the employee or prospective employee is claiming the identity of another individual.
#### (B) Using of counterfeit\-resistant documents
 If the system requires that a document be presented to or examined by an employer, the document must be in a form which is resistant to counterfeiting and tampering.
#### (C) Limited use of system
 Any personal information utilized by the system may not be made available to Government agencies, employers, and other persons except to the extent necessary to verify that an individual is not an unauthorized alien.
#### (D) Privacy of information
 The system must protect the privacy and security of personal information and identifiers utilized in the system.
#### (E) Limited denial of verification
 A verification that an employee or prospective employee is eligible to be employed in the United States may not be withheld or revoked under the system for any reason other than that the employee or prospective employee is an unauthorized alien.
#### (F) Limited use for law enforcement purposes
 The system may not be used for law enforcement purposes, other than for enforcement of this chapter or
 sections 1001, 1028, 1546, and 1621 of title 18
 .
#### (G) Restriction on use of new documents
 If the system requires individuals to present a new card or other document (designed specifically for use for this purpose) at the time of hiring, recruitment, or referral, then such document may not be required to be presented for any purpose other than under this chapter (or enforcement of
 sections 1001, 1028, 1546, and 1621 of title 18
 ) nor to be carried on one's person.
#### (3\) Notice to Congress before implementing changes

 Provision of additional information

 "(A) the individual's social security account number, if the individual has been issued such a number, and
 "(B) if the individual does not attest to United States citizenship under section 274A(b)(2\), such identification or authorization number established by the Immigration and Naturalization Service for the alien as the Secretary of Homeland Security shall specify,
 and shall retain the original form and make it available for inspection for the period and in the manner required of I–9 forms under section 274A(b)(3\).
 "(2\)
 Presentation of documentation.\-
 "(A)
 In general
 .\-The person or other entity, and the individual whose identity and employment eligibility are being confirmed, shall, subject to subparagraph (B), fulfill the requirements of section 274A(b) with the following modifications:

 "(ii) A document referred to in section 274A(b)(1\)(D) must contain a photograph of the individual.
 "(iii) The person or other entity has complied with the requirements of section 274A(b)(1\) with respect to examination of a document if the document reasonably appears on its face to be genuine and it reasonably appears to pertain to the individual whose identity and work eligibility is being confirmed.
 "(B)
 Limitation of requirement to examine documentation
 .\-If the Secretary of Homeland Security finds that a pilot program would reliably determine with respect to an individual whether\-
 "(i) the person with the identity claimed by the individual is authorized to work in the United States, and
 "(ii) the individual is claiming the identity of another person,
 if a person or entity could fulfill the requirement to examine documentation contained in subparagraph (A) of section 274A(b)(1\) by examining a document specified in either subparagraph (B) or (D) of such section, the Secretary of Homeland Security may provide that, for purposes of such requirement, only such a document need be examined. In such case, any reference in section 274A(b)(1\)(A) to a verification that an individual is not an unauthorized alien shall be deemed to be a verification of the individual's identity.
 "(3\)
 Seeking confirmation.\-
 "(A)
 In general
 .\-The person or other entity shall make an inquiry, as provided in section 404(a)(1\) of this division, using the confirmation system to seek confirmation of the identity and employment eligibility of an individual, by not later than the end of 3 working days (as specified by the Secretary of Homeland Security) after the date of the hiring (or recruitment or referral, as the case may be).
 "(B)
 Extension of time period
 .\-If the person or other entity in good faith attempts to make an inquiry during such 3 working days and the confirmation system has registered that not all inquiries were received during such time, the person or entity can make an inquiry in the first subsequent working day in which the confirmation system registers that it has received all inquiries. If the confirmation system cannot receive inquiries at all times during a day, the person or entity merely has to assert that the entity attempted to make the inquiry on that day for the previous sentence to apply to such an inquiry, and does not have to provide any additional proof concerning such inquiry.
 "(4\)
 Confirmation or nonconfirmation.\-
 "(A)
 Confirmation upon initial inquiry
 .\-If the person or other entity receives an appropriate confirmation of an individual's identity and work eligibility under the confirmation system within the time period specified under section 404(b) of this division, the person or entity shall record on the I–9 or similar form an appropriate code that is provided under the system and that indicates a final confirmation of such identity and work eligibility of the individual.
 "(B)
 Nonconfirmation upon initial inquiry and secondary verification.\-
 "(i)
 Nonconfirmation
 .\-If the person or other entity receives a tentative nonconfirmation of an individual's identity or work eligibility under the confirmation system within the time period specified under 404(b) of this division, the person or entity shall so inform the individual for whom the confirmation is sought.
 "(ii)
 No contest
 .\-If the individual does not contest the nonconfirmation within the time period specified in section 404(c) of this division, the nonconfirmation shall be considered final. The person or entity shall then record on the I–9 or similar form an appropriate code which has been provided under the system to indicate a tentative nonconfirmation.
 "(iii)
 Contest
 .\-If the individual does contest the nonconfirmation, the individual shall utilize the process for secondary verification provided under section 404(c) of this division. The nonconfirmation will remain tentative until a final confirmation or nonconfirmation is provided by the confirmation system within the time period specified in such section. In no case shall an employer terminate employment of an individual because of a failure of the individual to have identity and work eligibility confirmed under this section until a nonconfirmation becomes final. Nothing in this clause shall apply to a termination of employment for any reason other than because of such a failure.
 "(iv)
 Recording of conclusion on form
 .\-If a final confirmation or nonconfirmation is provided by the confirmation system under section 404(c) of this division regarding an individual, the person or entity shall record on the I–9 or similar form an appropriate code that is provided under the system and that indicates a confirmation or nonconfirmation of identity and work eligibility of the individual.
 "(C)
 Consequences of nonconfirmation.\-
 "(i)
 Termination or notification of continued employment
 .\-If the person or other entity has received a final nonconfirmation regarding an individual under subparagraph (B), the person or entity may terminate employment (or recruitment or referral) of the individual. If the person or entity does not terminate employment (or recruitment or referral) of the individual, the person or entity shall notify the Secretary of Homeland Security of such fact through the confirmation system or in such other manner as the Secretary of Homeland Security may specify.
 "(ii)
 Failure to notify
 .\-If the person or entity fails to provide notice with respect to an individual as required under clause (i), the failure is deemed to constitute a violation of section 274A(a)(1\)(B) with respect to that individual and the applicable civil monetary penalty under section 274A(e)(5\) shall be (notwithstanding the amounts specified in such section) no less than $500 and no more than $1,000 for each individual with respect to whom such violation occurred.
 "(iii)
 Continued employment after final nonconfirmation
 .\-If the person or other entity continues to employ (or to recruit or refer) an individual after receiving final nonconfirmation, a rebuttable presumption is created that the person or entity has violated section 274A(a)(1\)(A). The previous sentence shall not apply in any prosecution under section 274A(f)(1\).
 "(b)
 Citizen Attestation Pilot Program.\-
 "(1\)
 In general
 .\-Except as provided in paragraphs (3\) through (5\), the procedures applicable under the citizen attestation pilot program under this subsection shall be the same procedures as those under the E\-Verify Program under subsection (a).
 "(2\)
 Restrictions.\-
 "(A)
 State document requirement to participate in pilot program

 "(i) contains a photograph of the individual involved, and
 "(ii) has been determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security to have security features, and to have been issued through application and issuance procedures, which make such document sufficiently resistant to counterfeiting, tampering, and fraudulent use that it is a reliable means of identification for purposes of this section.
 "(B)
 Authorization to limit employer participation
 .\-The Secretary of Homeland Security may restrict the number of persons or other entities that may elect to participate in the citizen attestation pilot program under this subsection as the Secretary of Homeland Security determines to be necessary to produce a representative sample of employers and to reduce the potential impact of fraud.
 "(3\)

#### **Executive Documents**
#### Ex. Ord. No. 12989\. Economy and Efficiency in Government Procurement Through Compliance with Certain Immigration and Nationality Act Provisions and Use of an Electronic Employment Eligibility Verification System
 Ex. Ord. No. 12989, Feb. 13, 1996, 61 F.R. 6091, as amended by Ex. Ord. No. 13286, §19, Feb. 28, 2003, 68 F.R. 10623; Ex. Ord. No. 13465, §§1–6, June 6, 2008, 73 F.R. 33285–33287, provided:
 This order is designed to promote economy and efficiency in Federal Government procurement. Stability and dependability are important elements of economy and efficiency. A contractor whose workforce is less stable will be less likely to produce goods and services economically and efficiently than a contractor whose workforce is more stable. It is the policy of the executive branch to enforce fully the immigration laws of the United States, including the detection and removal of illegal aliens and the imposition of legal sanctions against employers that hire illegal aliens. Because of the worksite enforcement policy of the United States and the underlying obligation of the executive branch to enforce the immigration laws, contractors that employ illegal aliens cannot rely on the continuing availability and service of those illegal workers, and such contractors inevitably will have a less stable and less dependable workforce than contractors that do not employ such persons. Where a contractor assigns illegal aliens to work on Federal contracts, the enforcement of Federal immigration laws imposes a direct risk of disruption, delay, and increased expense in Federal contracting. Such contractors are less dependable procurement sources, even if they do not knowingly hire or knowingly continue to employ unauthorized workers.
 Contractors that adopt rigorous employment eligibility confirmation policies are much less likely to face immigration enforcement actions, because they are less likely to employ unauthorized workers, and they are therefore generally more efficient and dependable procurement sources than contractors that do not employ the best available measures to verify the work eligibility of their workforce. It is the policy of the executive branch to use an electronic employment verification system because, among other reasons, it provides the best available means to confirm the identity and work eligibility of all employees that join the Federal workforce. Private employers that choose to contract with the Federal Government should meet the same standard.
 I find, therefore, that adherence to the general policy of contracting only with providers that do not knowingly employ unauthorized alien workers and that have agreed to utilize an electronic employment verification system designated by the Secretary of Homeland Security to confirm the employment eligibility of their workforce will promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement.
 NOW, THEREFORE, to ensure the economical and efficient administration and completion of Federal Government contracts, and by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sub
 section 121(a) of title 40
 and
 section 301 of title 3, United States Code
 , it is hereby ordered as follows:
 Section
 1\. (a) It is the policy of the executive branch in procuring goods and services that, to ensure the economical and efficient administration and completion of Federal Government contracts, contracting agencies should not contract with employers that have not complied with section 274A(a)(1\)(A) and 274A(a)(2\) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (
 8 U.S.C. 1324a(a)(1\)(A), 1324a(a)(2\)
 ) (the "INA employment provisions") prohibiting the unlawful employment of aliens.
 (b) It is the policy of the executive branch in procuring goods and services that, to ensure the economical and efficient administration and completion of Federal Government contracts, contracting agencies may not enter into contracts with employers that do not use the best available means to confirm the work authorization of their workforce.
 (c) It is the policy of the executive branch to enforce fully the antidiscrimination provisions of the INA. Nothing in this order relieves employers of antidiscrimination obligations under section 274B of the INA (
 8 U.S.C. 1324b
 ) or any other law.
 (d) All discretion under this order shall be exercised consistent with the policies set forth in this section.
 Sec
 . 2\. Contractor, as used in this Executive order, shall have the same meaning as defined in subpart 9\.4 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
 Sec
 . 3\. Using the procedures established pursuant to
 8 U.S.C. 1324a(e)
 : (a) the Secretary of Homeland Security may investigate to determine whether a contractor or an organizational unit thereof is not in compliance with the INA employment provisions;
 (b) the Secretary of Homeland Security shall receive and may investigate complaints by employees of any entity covered under section 3(a) of this order where such complaints allege noncompliance with the INA employment provisions; and
 (c) the Attorney General shall hold such hearings as are required under
 8 U.S.C. 1324a(e)
 to determine whether an entity covered under section 3(a) is not in compliance with the INA employment provisions.
 Sec
 . 4\. (a) Whenever the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General determines that a contractor or an organizational unit thereof is not in compliance with the INA employment provisions, the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General shall transmit that determination to the appropriate contracting agency and such other Federal agencies as the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General may determine. Upon receipt of such determination from the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General, the head of the appropriate contracting agency shall consider the contractor or an organizational unit thereof for debarment as well as for such other action as may be appropriate in accordance with the procedures and standards prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
 (b) The head of the contracting agency may debar the contractor or an organizational unit thereof based on the determination of the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General that it is not in compliance with the INA employment provisions. Such determination shall not be reviewable in the debarment proceedings.
 (c) The scope of the debarment generally should be limited to those organizational units of a Federal contractor that the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General finds are not in compliance with the INA employment provisions.
 (d) The period of the debarment shall be for 1 year and may be extended for additional periods of 1 year if, using the procedures established pursuant to
 8 U.S.C. 1324a(e),
 the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General determines that the organizational unit of the Federal contractor continues to be in violation of the INA employment provisions.
 (e) The Administrator of General Services shall list a debarred contractor or an organizational unit thereof on the List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs and the contractor or an organizational unit thereof shall be ineligible to participate in any procurement or nonprocurement activities.
