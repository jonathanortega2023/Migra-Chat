​
A first generation Cuban American from Maywood, William is currently the Vice President and Head of Community Development for Advancing Hispanics and Latinos at JP Morgan Chase & Co. 
  
When asked what drew him to ICIRR’s board of directors, William stated, “My family came here in the 70s from Cuba and like many families, came in search of a better life. A life with the possibility to earn a decent wage and say what you want to say without fear of reprisal. When I look at my life, I stand on the shoulders of people like my grandfather and mother that worked tirelessly to provide me with opportunities. It’s my obligation to find ways to lift community with me. If we don’t do it, how can we expect others to do it. For me it’s personal.”
