Southern Border Arrival Assistance in Illinois
The Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights (ICIRR) is working closely with State and City governmental agencies and community partners through the Southern Border Arrivals Program (SBA) to assist southern border arrivals (asylum seekers who have been sent in buses by Texas Governor Abbot) in accessing essential services.
 
If you are an asylum seeker from the southern border in need of support, or know someone who is, you can call ICIRR’s Family Support Hotline (1-855-435-7693) or 3-1-1.
What to expect when calling 3-1-1 in Chicago:
* The options will be offered in English
* Remain on the line to be assisted with housing
* The asylum seeker’s full name and precise location must be provided
* Note: It can take up to 3-5 days to find shelter
Other Resources for Asylum Seekers:
* [Chicago CityKey Program](https://www.chicityclerk.com/about-citykey/chicago-citykey-program-update): You can use the CityKey as proof of identity in the City of Chicago, including when you open a bank account, rent an apartment, and apply for government services

Court Watch Volunteer Program
Court Watch is a volunteer program founded in 2007 to observe and bear witness at detained immigrants’ hearings in Chicago. While Illinois passed legislation that banned immigrant detention within our state beginning in 2022, deportation cases are still processed in the Chicago Immigration Court nearly every weekday for immigrants - including Illinois residents - who are jailed in Wisconsin, Indiana, Kentucky, and other states.
Can you volunteer a few hours a month to stand with detained immigrants?
Court Watch volunteers attend as many of these hearings as possible (most hearings are
currently conducted online via Webex). We partner with legal organizations and pro bono
attorneys, highlighting problems we observe and cases where unrepresented detainees are in
need of legal help. 
  
If you'd like to volunteer with us, please email [icirrcourtwatch@gmail.com](mailto:icirrcourtwatch@gmail.com?subject=Volunteer Interest in Court Watch Program).
