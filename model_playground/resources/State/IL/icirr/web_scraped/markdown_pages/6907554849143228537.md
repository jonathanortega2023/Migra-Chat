The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), signed into law by President Obama in 2010, requires states to participate in or set up health care exchanges by October 1, 2013. These health care exchanges serve as a marketplace for individuals and small businesses to purchase health insurance, including many individuals who have never had insurance, such as immigrants. Illinois plans to establish a partnership exchange in which the State will divide the responsibilities with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

​
The Affordable Care Act (ACA): A Reflection on Immigrant Access in Illinois provides awareness of enrollment issues immigrants and refugees faced in the Federal Health Insurance Marketplace (also referred to as the Marketplace) during the first “open enrollment.” Its focus is on lessons learned through the first year of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights’ (ICIRR) In-Person Counselor program. In July 2013, as part of the In-Person Counselor Program (IPC), the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) awarded ICIRR $1.25 million to provide outreach and enrollment in the Marketplace and Adult Medicaid for immigrant and refugee families. ICIRR created a network of 29 ethnic community- based organizations across Illinois dedicated to enrolling eligible uninsured immigrants and refugees.
