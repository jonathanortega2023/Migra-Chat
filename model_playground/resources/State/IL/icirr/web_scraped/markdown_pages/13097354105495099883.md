*ICIRR renews demand for healthcare for ALL, commits to organizing to win long-term revenue solutions*
  
On June 16, Governor J.B. Pritzker and the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS) announced new emergency rules that would restrict access and add cost burdens for immigrants seeking healthcare through two landmark state programs.
  
**STATEMENT from Lawrence Benito, executive director of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights:**
  
“Healthcare is a human right, and ICIRR has long been part of the fight to win healthcare for all regardless of immigration status. But Governor Pritzker’s emergency rules, which limit the Health Benefits for Immigrant Adults and Health Benefits for Immigrant Seniors programs (HBIA and HBIS), will decrease healthcare accessibility and increase costs for immigrants, effectively moving our state backwards after having made so much progress. These rules add disproportionate high costs to immigrants compared to other state Medicaid programs, which do not require the same excessive co-pays or enrollment limitations.
  
“ICIRR is committed to immediate and long-term solutions to win healthcare for all. We call on Governor Pritzker and HFS to reconsider their attempts to curtail our communities’ access to life saving care. We will also continue to organize to win revenue solutions that will not only make the current program whole again and expand coverage to all low-income immigrants regardless of age, but also fund the services and support programs that all Illinois residents need in order to live healthy, productive lives in this state.”
  
**CALL TO ACTION:**
* If you or someone in your family is eligible for HBIA or HBIS, we encourage you to enroll as soon as possible. Enrollment for HBIA closes and program caps for HBIS go into effect on July 1, 2023.
* Visit [icirr.org/ifrp](https://www.icirr.org/ifrp) to find an organization in your area that can assist with HBIA and HBIS enrollment or call the Family Support Network at 1-855-435-7693.
* Stay tuned for more information from Healthy Illinois and ICIRR member organizations who will run in person and virtual enrollment events in the coming week.
