Created in 1986 in response to President Reagan signing into law the Immigration Reform and Control Act, ICIRR has been at the forefront of helping immigrants realize and contribute to the dream that is America.  
   
 Since 1986, we have:  
 
* Established the first permanent line-item in the state budget dedicated to Immigrant Services in the country (2002).
​
* Passed pro-immigrant legislation at the state level that provided in-state tuition for undocumented students (2003); authorized religious ministry to immigrants detained in county jails for immigration enforcement purposes (2008); created a scholarship fund for immigrant youths pursuing higher education (2011); enabled undocumented drivers to get temporary visitor drivers licenses (2013); and bars local and state law enforcement from arresting and holding individuals based on their immigration status (2017).
​
* Established the creation of the Office of New Americans within the Governor’s office (2005) and the City of Chicago (2011).
​
* Created the New Americans Initiative (2005), which has helped 534,000 people gain access to citizenship
​
* Helped 105,394 immigrants prepare applications for citizenship.
​
* Created the Immigrant Family Resource Project (1999), which connected more than 500,000 individuals and families to safety net services.
​
* Created the New Americans Democracy Project (2004), which has registered over 250,000 new immigrant voters and engaged thousands of community volunteers in our democratic process.
​
* Successfully fought the opening of seven for-profit immigration prisons in Illinois and Indiana.
​
* Led efforts to create the Cook County Direct Access Program, which has expanded healthcare services to over 25,000 individuals since March of 2017 alone.
