​
In partnership with Immigrant Youth Justice League (IYJL) and Educators for Fair Consideration, ICIRR created two guides, one for undocumented students and another for their counselors. The guides review related topics pertinent to the college preparation process for undocumented students.

​
Student Access
​
The [Student ACCESS Bill](http://www.studentaccessil.com/) will provide legal authority to 4-year public universities in Illinois to provide financial aid to undocumented students who enroll at their institutions.
​
Undocumented students are currently ineligible to receive federal student aid, Pell grants, Illinois MAP Grants and other forms of state-based financial aid. However, federal law allows individual state legislatures to offer undocumented students eligibility for state financial aid. Passage of the Student ACCESS Bill would allow 4-year public universities to offer financial aid to every student enrolled at their institution on a competitive basis. The legislation will not, however, make undocumented students eligible to apply for the MAP Grant.
