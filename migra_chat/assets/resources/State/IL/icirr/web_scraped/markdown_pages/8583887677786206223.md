A MCO is a health plan or healthcare network (i.e. similar to a HMO). All of your doctors, hospitals, and providers belong to the same network and coordinate together to provide you the care you need.
 
The transition will be done in phases from January to April 2024. The Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS) will send program enrollees transition details in the mail.
What should individuals expect?
* You will be notified of your transition into a MCO nearly 2 months before the start date of your new health plan.
* The notification letter will include the date by which you will have to choose your health plan and primary provider. In Illinois, there are 5 MCOs (health plan options) including: 
	+ CountyCare (only for Cook county residents)
	+ Aetna
	+ Meridian
	+ Molina
	+ BlueCrossBlueShield
Read more about the MCOs on the [HealthChoice website](https://enrollhfs.illinois.gov/en/healthchoice-illinois).  
* If you do not choose a plan, you will be auto enrolled into a MCO and assigned a doctor
* Once enrolled, you will receive a new member ID card from your MCO that you’ll need for your healthcare services, including doctor or hospital visits.
What should individuals expect?
* Once you are enrolled into a MCO (health plan), you will have 90 days to select a different MCO. After the 90 days, you will have to wait one year to change your MCO.
* You can change primary doctor (within the same MCO) at any time during the year.
* MCOs are required to make oral interpretation and written translation services available free of charge in all languages.
* Clients may contact their MCO to request written materials in a specific language
* The use of health insurance through an MCO does not count towards public charge

Medicaid RedeterminationsThe Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS) is sending redetermination letters to Medicaid members. This is an annual renewal process required by federal law that requires all states verify individuals enrolled in Medicaid are still eligible for a given program. Individuals that are receiving these letters include but are not limited to those enrolled in All Kids, Moms and Babies, HBIA and HBIS. Members need to complete and submit this form to show that they are still eligible for Medicaid. It's important to complete this process before coverage expires!
 
From June 2023 to May 31, 2024, Medicaid members that did not submit their redetermination by the due date will be sent a follow-up letter and given a one-month grace period. 
 
Don’t miss your letter! Make sure that your address is up-to-date. To get information about your redetermination date or to update your address, you can go online or call HFS. 
​
Online:
* Click "Manage My Case" at abe.illinois.gov
* Verify your mailing address under "Contact Us"
* Find your due date (the "redetermination" date) in your "Benefit Details"
* Watch your mail and complete your renewal right away
