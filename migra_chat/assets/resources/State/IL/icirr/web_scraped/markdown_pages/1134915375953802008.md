-----------------
At ICIRR, we fundamentally believe that our diversity makes America a stronger nation. We also know that people are stronger together than they are individually, so we ask that you take a stand on behalf of immigrants and refugees and help us lift up and empower these communities. Together, we can help people realize the American dream. We have a number of ways you can make a difference in the lives of immigrants and refugees in Illinois:
