[COVID Help](https://www.icirr.org/covid-19-resource-guide)[Resources](https://www.icirr.org/resources)[Donate](https://illinoiscoalitionforimmigrantandrefugeerights-bloom.kindful.com/?campaign=1242232)The Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights (ICIRR) announces the New Americans Democracy Project, a four to six month fellowship program for young people who are interested in working hard while exploring a career in social justice and electoral/political work, receiving quality training, and contributing to the participation of new citizens in the American democratic process.
​
Qualifications
​
We are looking for applicants who are willing to work hard and are passionate about social justice and democratic participation. Previous experience is not required, although we anticipate that successful candidates will have been active in their communities on issues that matter to them.
​
Because fellows will be working with community volunteers and conductive extensive outreach, this will not be a 9-5 job, but will require commitment and flexibility. It will be essential to have a full-time use of a car. 
​
Applicants who speak languages of targeted immigrant communities are especially encouraged to apply: Spanish, Arabic, Korean, Hindi, Urdu, Mandarin, Cantonese, Tagalog, etc.
 
Because of the rapid growth of immigrant populations beyond the city of Chicago, placements will be in Chicago as well as in some or all of the following locations: Waukegan, Wheeling, Schaumburg, Des Plaines, Hanover Park, Elgin, Carpentersville, Aurora, West Chicago, DuPage County, Joliet, Melrose Park, and Bridgeview, among other areas.
​
Responsibilities
​
Fellows will be placed with allied organizations in immigrant communities around the metro-Chicago land area and will work with their placement organizations to develop a local volunteer recruitment strategy and carry out intensive voter registration campaigns, focusing on new citizens in immigrant communities. In the weeks leading up to the November 2018 elections, fellows will work with these volunteers to conduct GOTV activities. All work will be non-partisan (not supporting a particular candidate or party), and will be carried under non-profit 501(C)(3) guidelines.
 
Staff from the Fellow's host organization will provide day-to-day supervision, in addition to a mentor from ICIRR staff. 
​
Compensation
​
This is a paid fellowship that runs until November 16, 2018, and will pay fellows a stipend of $550 per week (which includes a $50 reimbursement for phone and mileage). 
​
Participants will receive training in the skills of community organizing, non-partisan voter registration and "Get-Out-The-Vote" (GOTV) efforts from the staff, members and allies of ICIRR. These allies include community-based organizations with decades of experience in community and direct-action organizing as well as national groups like Wellstone Action and the Center for Community Change, both national leaders in electoral organizing and training. Furthermore, ICIRR will provide training on immigration issues and working with immigrant communities. 
​
Fellows will initially receive 5 days of paid training, supplemented with training throughout the length of the fellowship. 
​
This program will run from mid-July to mid-November 2018.
