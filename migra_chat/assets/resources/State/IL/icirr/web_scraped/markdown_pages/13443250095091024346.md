--------------------------
In the fall of 2022, ICIRR member organizations held a series of community meetings with their grassroots leaders to determine our coalition's policy priorities for the upcoming year. Collectively, ICIRR members ratified our 2023 policy platform and publicly announced it in October 2022. 
 
Since January 2023, ICIRR members have organized in support of our 2023 pro-immigrant platform. They’ve met with legislators in their districts and in Springfield. Along the way, our members empowered grassroots leaders to show their POWER in the legislative process.
This year's wins include:
=========================
Immigrant Services Line Item
============================
$38 million allocated for the Immigrant Services Line Item, which includes essential public benefits assistance; necessary cash assistance for immigrant families; citizenship and DACA application assistance; and ongoing case management support for Afghan, Ukrainian, and southern border arrivals.
