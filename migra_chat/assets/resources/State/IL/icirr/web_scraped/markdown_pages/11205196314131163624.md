Updated 9-14-23
UPDATE, On September 13, 2023, the federal judge in Texas overseeing the lawsuit challenging DACA ruled that the Biden Administration’s updated federal regulations are unlawful. The DACA case will be appealed to a higher court.
​
FOR OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS: Those who have DACA can continue to renew their DACA and work permits and apply for advance parole. However, the Department of Homeland Security is still not processing any new initial DACA applications. This remains unchanged from prior to the September 13 ruling. 
 
Contact an ICIRR partner organization if you’re ready to renew your DACA:
