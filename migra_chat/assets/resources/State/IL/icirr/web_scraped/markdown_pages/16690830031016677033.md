------------------------------------------------
Updated 4-7-23
The SNAP program at ICIRR is dedicated to providing equal access to health and safety-net services for immigrants and refugees. Through a network of 44 ethnic community-based organizations operating in over 60 different languages across Illinois, communities are provided access to safety-net services. 
 
The SNAP program is a partnership between the Illinois Department of Human Services (IDHS) and the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights (ICIRR). In 2010, this network was integrated into the federally funded Illinois SNAP & WIC Outreach Plan.
