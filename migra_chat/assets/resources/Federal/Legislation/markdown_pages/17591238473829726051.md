#### **Editorial Notes**
#### References in Text
The Alien Registration Act, 1940, referred to in subsecs. (a) and (b), is act [June 28, 1940, ch. 439, 54 Stat. 670](/statviewer.htm?volume=54&page=670). Sections 30 and 31 of that act were classified to sections 451 and 452 of this title and were repealed by section 403(a)(39) of act June 27, 1952.
#### Amendments

**1986**-Pub. L. 99–653, §9, as amended by Pub. L. 100–525, added subsec. (c). As originally enacted, Pub. L. 99–653, §9, amended subsec. (a) of this section by striking out "section 1201(b) of this title or" after "registered and fingerprinted under". Pub. L. 100–525 revised Pub. L. 99–653, §9, so as to add subsec. (c) and eliminate the original amendment of subsec. (a), thereby restoring the words "section 1201(b) of this title or". See Effective Date of 1988 Amendment note below.
