Because June 30 falls on a Sunday, consistent with USCIS policy, USCIS will consider properly filed paper H-1B cap subject petitions received at a USCIS Lockbox Facility on July 1, 2024, as timely filed (i.e., USCIS will consider the paper-filed H-1B petitions to have been received on June 30). ALERT: At intake, we determine whether the payment you submitted matches the correct fees due. If you do not submit the correct fee, we must reject your form, even if you have submitted an overpayment. The required fees for Form I-129, Form I-129CW, and Form I-140 depend on how you answer the form’s questions about your status as a nonprofit or small employer. See our Web Alert for more information: USCIS Reminds Certain Employment-Based Petitioners to Submit the Correct Required Fees. You can find additional filing fee information by visiting our Filing Fees page, our Form G-1055, Fee Schedule, and our Frequently Asked Questions on the USCIS Fee Rule page. ALERT: As of April 1, 2024, USCIS service centers are no longer accepting Form I-129 petitions requesting H-1B or H-1B1 (HSC) classification. We will reject H-1B or H-1B1 (HSC) petitions received at a USCIS service center on or after April 1, 2024. There will be no grace period provided. As of April 1, 2024, all paper-filed Form I-129 petitions requesting H-1 or H-1B1 (HSC) classification, including those with a concurrent Form I-907, Request for Premium Processing Service, and those with concurrently filed Form I-539 and/or Form I-765, must be filed at a USCIS lockbox facility. You can find the lockbox filing addresses for paper-filed forms on our Form I-129 Direct Filing Addresses page. If you are filing Form I-129 alone or with Form I-907, you may also file online. On March 25, USCIS launched online filing of Form I-129 and associated Form I-907 for non-cap H-1B petitions. On April 1, USCIS began accepting online filing for H-1B cap petitions and associated Forms I-907 for petitioners whose registrations have been selected. To file online, visit myaccount.uscis.gov. In addition, on Feb. 28, 2024, USCIS launched new USCIS organizational accounts that allow multiple people within a company and their legal representatives to collaborate and prepare H-1B registrations, online H-1B petitions, and associated online requests for premium processing. ALERT: If you are an H-1B or an L-1 nonimmigrant and your dependent spouse or child is applying for an extension of their existing H-4 or L-2 status, or a change of status to H-4 or L-2, we will adjudicate your dependent spouse or child’s application together with your Form I-129 if the Form I-539 is packaged together with and properly filed at the same time and in the same location as your Form I-129. This means that an officer will review the H-4 or L-2 derivative’s Form I-539 after reviewing the principal’s Form I-129 and will take appropriate adjudicative action (that is, issue an approval, denial, RFE, NOID or refer for an investigation) after that adjudicative review. This includes a Form I-765 filed by your dependent spouse for an employment authorization document based on H-4 or L-2 status, as applicable. If your dependent’s associated applications are not properly submitted together with your Form I-129, we will adjudicate them separately.

For those petitioners that wish to be considered for the fee exemption and whose Afghan national relative was not born in Afghanistan, you cannot submit your petition online. You must complete a paper version of Form I-130 (PDF, 715.81 KB) and follow the instructions for filing the Form I-130 by mail (paper). Use this form if you (the petitioner) are a U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident, or U.S. national and you need to establish your qualifying relationship with an eligible relative (the beneficiary) who wishes to come to or stay in the United States permanently and apply for the Permanent Resident Card (also called a Green Card). You must select only 1 option for Part 4 (Question 61 or 62) to indicate whether the beneficiary will seek adjustment of status inside the United States or consular processing abroad. Do not complete both questions, and do not leave this section blank. File Online Processing Information Submitting Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative, is the first step to help an eligible relative apply to immigrate to the United States and apply for a Green Card. The filing or approval of this petition does not give your relative any immigration status or benefit. We will generally approve your Form I-130 if you can establish a qualifying relationship between you and your relative that allows them to immigrate to the United States. Generally, after we approve the petition, your relative may apply for a Green Card. If your relative is already in the United States and an immigrant visa is available, they may be eligible to apply for their Green Card by filing Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status. Certain relatives must wait until an immigrant visa number is available before they can file Form I-485 (to adjust their status if they are in the United States) or request an immigrant visa at an embassy or consulate through consular processing (if they are outside the United States). However, if your relative qualifies as an immediate relative, an immigrant visa is always available. If your relative is already in the United States but they are not eligible to apply for the Green Card by filing Form I-485, the relative may be eligible to apply for an immigrant visa with the U.S. Department of State at a U.S. embassy or consulate through consular processing. For more information on eligibility and the process to apply for a Green Card, please visit our Green Card Eligibility Categories page. When you complete Form I-130, please make sure that you (the petitioner) select 1 and only 1 option indicating whether the beneficiary requests adjustment of status inside the United States or consular processing outside the United States. If the Form I-130 is still pending with USCIS and you want to change your selection (either to consular processing outside the United States or to adjustment of status in the United States), you may contact the USCIS Contact Center and request a change. If you want to change your selection to consular processing after we have already approved your petition, you may need to file Form I-824, Application for Action on an Approved Application or Petition.

I-131,Application for Travel Document,https://www.uscis.gov/i-131,False,,"ALERT: On Feb. 27, 2024, we announced a process for eligible Ukrainian citizens and their immediate family members to apply for re-parole so they can continue to temporarily remain in the United States. We encourage eligible Ukrainian citizens and their immediate family members to submit their re-parole requests to us no earlier than 180 days (6 months) before the expiration of their current period of parole. You can find your parole expiration date on your Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record, issued by U.S. Customs and Border Protection when you were paroled into the United States. Filing during this window reduces the risk that your current period of parole and employment authorization will expire before you receive a decision on your re-parole request. If you submit a request for re-parole more than 180 days before the expiration of your current period of parole, we may reject or deny your re-parole application without refunding the filing fees. Please note that filing earlier than 180 days before your current parole expiration date will not result in a faster decision. ALERT: Beginning July 1, 2022, we will issue a new travel authorization document to Temporary Protected Status (TPS) beneficiaries: Form I-512T, Authorization for Travel by a Noncitizen to the United States, at our discretion if we find the beneficiary merits this authorization. We will no longer issue advance parole documents as evidence of our prior authorization for a TPS beneficiary to be permitted to reenter the United States if the beneficiary travels outside the United States. Beginning July 1, 2022, we will issue a new travel authorization document to Temporary Protected Status (TPS) beneficiaries: Form I-512T, Authorization for Travel by a Noncitizen to the United States, at our discretion if we find the beneficiary merits this authorization. We will no longer issue advance parole documents as evidence of our prior authorization for a TPS beneficiary to be permitted to reenter the United States if the beneficiary travels outside the United States. If you are a TPS beneficiary with an existing, unexpired advance parole document, you may continue to travel and seek reentry to the United States after a trip outside the United States through the period of validity printed on your advance parole document. If you are a TPS beneficiary applying for a new travel authorization document, you should continue to use Form I-131, Application for Travel Document. If you have a pending Form I-131, you do not need to file a new application. We will continue to issue advance parole documents to noncitizens with pending initial applications for TPS (Form I-821). TPS beneficiaries and individuals with pending initial TPS applications should carefully read the Form I-131 Instructions which contain warnings about certain risks an individual may face if they are outside of the United States while USCIS is considering their TPS reregistration or initial application, such as missing important request for evidence or other notices or being denied TPS while outside the United States. ALERT: Court decisions regarding DACA. On Sept. 13, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas issued a decision finding the DACA Final Rule unlawful and expanding the original July 16, 2021, injunction and order of vacatur to cover the Final Rule. However, the court maintained a partial stay of the order for “all DACA recipients who received their initial DACA status prior to July 16, 2021.” See the Memorandum and Order (PDF, 1.35 MB) and Supplemental Order of Injunction (PDF, 72.53 KB). Accordingly, current grants of DACA and related Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) remain valid until they expire, unless individually terminated. In accordance with this decision, USCIS will continue to accept and process DACA renewal requests and accompanying applications for employment authorization under the DACA regulations at 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23, as it has since October 31, 2022. We will also continue to accept initial DACA requests, but in accordance with the District Court’s order, we will not process initial DACA requests. Current valid grants of DACA and related EADs will continue to be recognized as valid under the Final Rule. This means that individuals with DACA and related EADs do not have to submit a request for DACA or employment authorization until the appropriate time to seek renewal. Please see the DACA Litigation Information Page for important updates and information related to court rulings on the DACA policy. Use this form to apply for a reentry permit, refugee travel document, TPS travel authorization document, advance parole document (including parole into the United States for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit), or advance permission to travel for Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) long-term residents. For information on travel documents, including potential immigration-related consequences of traveling outside the United States, see our Travel Documents page.

I-730,Refugee/Asylee Relative Petition,https://www.uscis.gov/i-730,False,,"ALERT: Effective May 6, 2024, all Form I-730 following to join refugee (FTJ-R) petitions are being processed at the USCIS International Operations Division rather than the Asylum Vetting Center. We shifted this workload to better serve Form I-730 petitioners and beneficiaries by establishing a dedicated team with primary responsibility for initial domestic processing of FTJ-R petitions. This will help us process this critical family reunification program more efficiently. We will automatically transfer any pending Form I-730 FTJ-R petitions filed by refugee petitioners from the Asylum Vetting Center to USCIS International Operations and send the petitioner a transfer notice. If you have a pending Form I-730 FTJ-R petition, please refer to the transfer notice you receive for more information about the transfer of your petition. Please note, USCIS International Operations is not open to the public and does not accept requests or inquiries made in person. Because the Asylum Vetting Center no longer completes initial domestic processing of Form I-730 FTJ-R petitions, the Asylum Vetting Center cannot respond to any Form I-730 FTJ-R inquiries. Please do not go to or make inquiries at the Asylum Vetting Center or any asylum office because office staff are not able to receive or respond to any Form I-730 inquiries. REMINDER: Please submit a passport-style photograph or a recently taken clear photograph of each family member you are petitioning for. If you do not provide the required photo, we may issue a Request for Evidence (RFE), and it could take longer to process your petition. If you are a principal refugee admitted to the United States within the past 2 years or a principal asylee who was granted asylum within the past 2 years, you (the petitioner) may use this form to request that your spouse and unmarried children under 21 years of age (the beneficiaries) join you in the United States. In certain circumstances, unmarried children over 21 years old may be eligible for following-to-join immigration benefits. For more information, see our Child Status Protection Act page. In some cases, we may grant a waiver of the 2-year filing deadline for humanitarian reasons. See the Instructions for Form I-730 (PDF, 91.53 KB) for more information. The processing of Form I-730 petitions depends on various factors, including your status as a principal asylee or refugee and the current location of your beneficiary. Form I-730 processing is divided into three steps: Receipt and Initial Domestic Processing The Service Center Operations Directorate (SCOPS) receives all Form I-730 petitions. SCOPS performs initial domestic processing of Form I-730 following-to-join asylee (FTJ-A) petitions. The Refugee, Asylum and International Operations Directorate (RAIO) performs initial domestic processing of Form I-730 following-to-join refugee (FTJ-R) petitions at USCIS International Operations. Generally, USCIS processes Form I-730 petitions in the order we receive them. If we need additional evidence, we will issue you a request for evidence (RFE) and give you an opportunity to respond. Beneficiary Interview and Additional Processing Once we complete initial domestic processing of your Form I-730 petition, and if we determine that your relative appears eligible as a follow-to-join asylee or refugee, we will send your petition to the appropriate office to interview your spouse or child and continue processing. After receiving your petition, the interviewing office will notify you, your spouse or child, and any representative of record, and provide additional instructions. If the beneficiary is located within the United States, we will forward the petition to the appropriate USCIS domestic field office based on the beneficiary’s residence. We will send you a transfer notice listing the USCIS field office. You can find more information on USCIS domestic field offices on the USCIS Field Offices page. If the beneficiary is located outside of the United States, we will forward the petition through the Department of State’s (DOS) National Visa Center (NVC) to a USCIS international field oﬀice or a U.S. embassy or consulate with jurisdiction over the beneficiary’s residence. If your beneficiary is located outside of the United States in a country where USCIS has an international field office with jurisdiction over the country where your beneficiary lives, your beneficiary will be interviewed by USCIS. You will receive a transfer notice listing the USCIS international field office that will interview your beneficiary and complete processing. Currently, USCIS maintains international field offices in China, Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Kenya, Mexico, Qatar, and Turkey. Please note that the USCIS Nairobi Field Office also processes Form I-730 following-to-join refugee petitions for beneficiaries located in Burundi and Uganda. You can find information about USCIS international offices on the USCIS International Immigration Offices page. If your beneficiary is located outside of the United States in a country with no USCIS international field office presence or jurisdiction, a DOS embassy or consulate will interview and complete processing of your beneficiary on USCIS’ behalf and will determine your beneficiary’s eligibility to travel to the United States. If your beneficiary will be interviewed at a DOS embassy or consulate, you will receive an approval notice from USCIS after initial domestic processing of your petition is complete. You can find more information about U.S. embassies and consulates on the DOS U.S. Embassy Locator page, which also includes details on whether the U.S. embassy or consulate is open for interviews and additional processing. Department of State Returns If DOS interviews and processes the beneficiary outside the United States and finds a basis for ineligibility, DOS will return the petition to the domestic USCIS processing component for further review of the decision. We will then review the Form I-730 petition and may re-open the petition and request additional information, deny the petition, or reaffirm the petition and return it to DOS for continued processing.",i-590.pdf,https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/forms/i-590.pdf,"{'i-730.pdf': 'https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/forms/i-730.pdf', 'i-730instr.pdf': 'https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/forms/i-730instr.pdf'}"

I-765,Application for Employment Authorization,https://www.uscis.gov/i-765,False,,"ALERT – NEW TEMPORARY FINAL RULE INCREASES AUTOMATIC EXTENSION PERIOD FOR CERTAIN EAD RENEWAL APPLICANTS: On April 4, 2024, USCIS announced a temporary final rule (TFR) that increased the automatic extension period for employment authorization and EADs of certain EAD renewal applicants from up to 180 days to up to 540 days. The new temporary final rule is effective on April 8, 2024. This temporary final rule will apply to EAD renewal applicants eligible to receive an automatic extension who timely and properly filed their Form I-765 applications on or after Oct. 27, 2023, if the application is still pending on April 8, 2024. The temporary final rule will also apply to EAD renewal applicants eligible to receive an automatic extension who timely and properly file their Form I-765 application on or after April 8, 2024, and on or before Sept. 30, 2025 (540 days after publication of this temporary final rule in the Federal Register. 2022 TFR PREVIOUSLY INCREASED AUTOMATIC EXTENSION PERIOD On May 4, 2022, DHS published a temporary final rule (TFR) titled “Temporary Increase of the Automatic Extension Period of Employment Authorization and Documentation for Certain Renewal Applicants” (2022 TFR) in the Federal Register. The rule temporarily amended DHS regulations at 8 CFR 274a.13(d) by adding a new paragraph 8 CFR 274a.13(d)(5), which lengthened the automatic extension period provided in that section from up to 180 days to up to 540 days for those categories described in the TFR, upon timely and properly filing of an EAD renewal application. That increase was available to eligible renewal applicants whose EAD applications were pending as of May 4, 2022, including those applicants whose employment authorization had already lapsed following the initial 180-day extension period, and to eligible applicants who filed an EAD renewal application during the 540-day period beginning on or after May 4, 2022, and ending Oct. 26, 2023. Automatic extensions of employment authorization and EAD validity for EAD renewal filings made on or after Oct. 27, 2023, reverted to the original up to 180-day period for those eligible applicants who timely and properly file Form I-765 renewal applications. That reversion was not retroactive; all previous up to 540-day automatic extensions for EAD renewal applications filed before Oct. 27, 2023, remain in place. For individuals who received an increased automatic extension under the first temporary final rule, the automatic extension generally will end when their application is approved or denied, or the end of the up to 540-day period, whichever comes earlier. ALERT: Please remember that photos submitted to USCIS must be unmounted and unretouched. Unretouched means the photos must not be edited or digitally enhanced.

I-821D,Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals,https://www.uscis.gov/i-821d,False,,"ALERT: Important Reminders Regarding the DACA Renewal Process We continue to adjudicate the majority of DACA renewal requests within 120 days and make every effort to efficiently process these requests as we receive them. USCIS Historical Data shows the median processing time for DACA renewals and associated Employment Authorization Documents in fiscal year 2023 was 1 month, and less than 2 months for the first quarter of FY 2024. As USCIS has long recommended, we strongly encourage DACA recipients to submit your DACA renewal request to us between 120 and 150 days (4 to 5 months) before the expiration date located on your current Form I-797 DACA approval notice. Filing during this window reduces the risk that your current period of DACA and employment authorization will expire before you receive a decision on your renewal request. Please note that filing earlier than 150 days before your current DACA expiration date will not result in a faster decision. For additional information on DACA, including the requirements for renewal, please visit uscis.gov/DACA. ALERT: Court decisions regarding DACA. On Sept. 13, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas issued a decision finding the DACA Final Rule unlawful and expanding the original July 16, 2021 injunction and order of vacatur to cover the Final Rule. However, the court maintained a partial stay of the order for “all DACA recipients who received their initial DACA status prior to July 16, 2021.” See the Memorandum and Order (PDF, 1.35 MB) and Supplemental Order of Injunction (PDF, 72.53 KB). Accordingly, current grants of DACA and related Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) remain valid until they expire, unless individually terminated. In accordance with this decision, USCIS will continue to accept and process DACA renewal requests and accompanying applications for employment authorization under the DACA regulations at 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23, as it has since October 31, 2022. We will also continue to accept initial DACA requests, but in accordance with the District Court’s order, we will not process initial DACA requests. Current valid grants of DACA and related EADs will continue to be recognized as valid under the Final Rule. This means that individuals with DACA and related EADs do not have to submit a request for DACA or employment authorization until the appropriate time to seek renewal. Please see the DACA Litigation Information Page for important updates and information related to court rulings on the DACA policy. Use this form to request that we consider a renewal of your deferred action status on a case-by-case basis. Deferred action is an act of prosecutorial discretion to defer removal of an individual.
